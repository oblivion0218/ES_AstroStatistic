    "\n",
    "The dataset is at `solutions/galaxyquasar.csv`. I have extracted it myself from the SDSS database using the SQL query reported [here](https://www.astroml.org/_modules/astroML/datasets/sdss_galaxy_colors.html#fetch_sdss_galaxy_colors)\n",

    "- Create arrays for the $(u-g)$, $(g-r)$, $(r-i)$, and $(i-z)$ colors. Also create an array with the class labels where galaxy=$0$ and quasar=$1$. \n",

    "- Try using different colors (a subset of them first, than all together). Which is the most important feature?\n",
    "- What are the colors that better satisfy or invalidate the \"Naive\" assumption of independence between the attributes?"
