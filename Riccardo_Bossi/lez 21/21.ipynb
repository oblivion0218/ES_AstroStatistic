    "Today we'll play with the TensorFlow playground. We'll see it next time, but Tensorflow is one of the main open-source deep learning libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The playground provides some datasets and let you see what's going on during the training process in a nice, intuitive way. \n",

    "- We have a function $f(x_1,x_2)$ that returns +1 (blue) or -1 (orange).\n",
    "- We are given a dataset and split it into training and testing. \n",
    "- Hit play, and the network starts training.\n",
    "- The thickness of the line tells you how much that synapis contributes to the training.\n",
    "- You can monitor progress on the top-right.\n",
    "- The goal of the game is to minimize the loss function **on the test set** (I don't care about the loss function on the training set!).\n",
    "- You can change everything but the type of problem, the test/train ratio, and the noise level.\n",
    "- So feel free to play with activation function, number of layers, number of neuron per layers, learning rate, regularization, incoming features (data augmentation), etc. \n",

    "1) Let's start from [this dataset](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=linear&regularization=L2&batchSize=10&dataset=xor&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.01&regularizationRate=0&noise=35&networkShape=1&seed=0.50246&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false). Try to get the lowest score on the test set. Take a screenshot or we won't believe you! Let's draw a leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Then move on to [this dataset](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&regularization=L2&batchSize=10&dataset=spiral&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.1&regularizationRate=0.01&noise=50&networkShape=3,2&seed=0.65406&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false), which is more challenging.
