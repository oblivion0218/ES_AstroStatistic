    "Example:\n",

    "    - A prior that is intentionally vague or flat, expressing no strong belief about the parameter before seeing the data.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "For the same coin-flip scenario, if you have no idea about the bias, you might use a uniform prior over [0, 1], this assumes all probabilities are equally likely.\n",
