    "### **Transformations of Random Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming a random variable means applying a function to it to create a new one. This is often necessary when we are interested in a quantity that depends on a known random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with known probability density function (PDF) $f_X(x)$, and let $Y = g(X)$ be a transformation of $X$. If the function $g$ is **invertible** and **differentiable**, then the probability density function of $Y$, denoted $f_Y(y)$, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_Y(y) = f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \\cdot \\left| \\frac{d}{dy} g^{-1}(y) \\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuitive Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you know how $X$ behaves — for example, its PDF describes how likely different values of $X$ are. Now, you define a new variable $Y$ by applying a function $g$ to $X$. You want to understand how $Y$ behaves: how its probabilities are distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple way to think about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you apply $g$ to $X$, you're **remapping** the real line: every value of $x$ is being shifted or stretched into a new value $y = g(x)$.\n",
    "- But probability doesn’t disappear or appear — it just **moves around**. So, the probability that $X$ is near some value $x$ becomes the probability that $Y$ is near $g(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the new density $f_Y(y)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start from the original density**: You look at the density of $X$ at the point $x = g^{-1}(y)$. That’s the value of $X$ that maps to $y$.\n",
    "2. **Adjust for stretching or compressing**: The function $g$ might stretch or squeeze the space around $y$. This change is measured by the **derivative** of the inverse function, $\\left| \\frac{d}{dy} g^{-1}(y) \\right|$.\n",
    "   - If the transformation **compresses** values together (e.g., maps a wide range of $x$ to a narrow range of $y$), the density increases.\n",
    "   - If it **stretches** values apart (e.g., maps a small range of $x$ to a large range of $y$), the density decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:  \n",
    "The formula tells you how to translate probabilities from $X$ to $Y$ by \"following the mass\" through the transformation and adjusting for any stretching or shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the total probability remains 1, and the new PDF correctly reflects the behavior of the transformed variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Squaring a Uniform Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now define $Y = X^2$. We want to find the distribution of $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Invert the transformation: $X = \\sqrt{Y}$\n",
    "- Compute the derivative: $\\frac{d}{dy} \\sqrt{y} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now apply the change-of-variable formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_Y(y) = f_X(\\sqrt{y}) \\cdot \\left| \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}} \\right| = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}} & \\text{if } 0 \\leq y \\leq 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformed variable $Y = X^2$ has a distribution that is concentrated more near 0 than near 1, even though $X$ was uniform. This shows how transformations can significantly affect the shape of a distribution.\n"

It usually represents the idea that there is **no effect**, **no difference**, or **no relationship** between variables. For example, $H_0$ might state that the mean of a population is equal to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** This is the hypothesis you want to test or provide evidence for. It represents a change, effect, or difference from what the null hypothesis states. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Statistic:** To test the hypotheses, a test statistic is computed from the sample data. This statistic measures how far the observed data are from what would be expected if $H_0$ were true. Different tests have different statistics (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-square test).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **p-value:** The p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true, of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. In other words, it quantifies how likely your data would be if there were actually no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A **small p-value** indicates that the observed data is unlikely under $H_0$, so we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "    - A prior that is intentionally vague or flat, expressing no strong belief about the parameter before seeing the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Manifold learning methods are **non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques** that assume data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. These techniques aim to **uncover the underlying structure** of the data.\n",

    "### **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the local structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does LLE do?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLE assumes that high-dimensional data points lie on a smooth, lower-dimensional surface (called a manifold) and that, around each point, this surface is approximately flat (i.e., locally linear). LLE tries to capture this local linear structure and reconstruct it in fewer dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLE works in two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Capture the Local Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each data point, identify its $k$ nearest neighbors (based on Euclidean distance).\n",
    "- Compute weights that best express each point as a linear combination of its neighbors.  \n",
    "  In other words, for each point $x_i$:\n",
    "  $$ x_i \\approx \\sum_j w_{ij} x_j $$\n",
    "  where the sum is over the $k$ nearest neighbors of $x_i$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- These weights reflect how each point depends on its neighbors in the original space. They are stored in a matrix $W$, where most entries are zero (since each point only depends on a few neighbors).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Find a Lower-Dimensional Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the same weights $W$, find a set of new points $y_i$ in lower dimension (e.g., 2D or 3D) that preserve the same reconstruction pattern:\n",
    "  $$ y_i \\approx \\sum_j w_{ij} y_j $$\n",
    "- This means the relationships between points in the new space mimic the ones in the original space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is LLE useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can \"unroll\" curved surfaces like the famous S-curve or Swiss roll, revealing their intrinsic low-dimensional structure.\n",
    "- Unlike linear methods like PCA, LLE can deal with non-linear manifolds.\n",

    "Generative classification is a probabilistic approach that models **how the data is generated**. The key idea is to estimate the distribution of features for each class and then apply **Bayes’ theorem** to make predictions. This contrasts with discriminative methods, which model the decision boundary directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key idea is that a computer is a simple machine, even if the software we write can be very complicated. All a computer can do at the chip level are elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). Given a complicated piece of software, one can track the (very long!) lists of elemetary function that are required to reproduce the result. With this list, computing a derivative is just a long but trivial application of the chain rule. In practice, this means that derivates of any oder can be computed accurately to working precision very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other computational revolution behind the success of deep learning is the exploitation of **Graphic processing units (GPUs)** . CPUs are the standard silicon chips used by all computers, including your laptopt. GPUs are graphic boards designed for expensive video rendering (the market was largely driven by gaming professionals; now it's all AI). It turns out they're extremely good at matrix multiplication, and deep learning has lots of matrices.\n",

    "No layers are needed for linear regression.  We just connect our input to the output where the synapses are the weights (slopes) and the output neurons add the constant (intecept).\n",
    "\n",
    "So you might start with a single layer, then add more layers and use cross-validation to determine when you are overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are lots hidden layers (where \"lots\" is not clearly defined) then we call that a **deep neural network or **deep learning**.\n",

    "The number of neurons in each layer is also a free parameter. \n",

    "- **Typically choose somewhere between twice the number of input nodes and a number between the number of input and output nodes.**\n",

    "- Sometimes the number of neurons in each layer goes down.  But it can also be useful to have the same number in each layer so that there is only one hyperparameter (the number of neurons) and not one per layer, obviously it depend on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In practice a reasonable approach is to simply **specify many more layers and neurons than you need and perform regularization**. This can be as simple as just stopping the training when the cross-validation error reaches a minimum, which is called **early stopping**.\n",

    "While the number of neurons in the hidden layers are free parameters the number of input and output nodes are constrained by the data and the desired output.

    "\n",
    "- **L1 (LASSO)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization add penalties to large weights.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Batch Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we normalize input data before training, we can also normalize the outputs of hidden layers — this technique is called **batch normalization**.\n",
    "(A batch is simply a small subset of the training data used to compute the gradient and update the model’s weights once during training)\n",

    "- **Act as a form of regularization**, reducing the need for other techniques like dropout in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Augmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is a technique to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This helps the model **generalize better** and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "- **Adding extra features** such as polynomial terms (e.g., $x^2 $) to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- For images, applying transformations like **rotation**, **flipping**, **scaling**, or **zooming** to simulate different perspectives and conditions.\n",

    "### **Faster Optimizers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizers are algorithms that determine how the neural network’s weights are updated during training.

    "- **Adagrad:**  \n",
    "  Adjusts the learning rate for each parameter dynamically, giving smaller updates for parameters associated with frequently occurring features, and larger updates for infrequent features. It works well for sparse data but can slow down over time.\n",

    "#### **How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer applies small filters (also called **kernels**) — such as $3 \\times 3$ or $5 \\times 5$ — across the input image.  \n",
    "Each filter is designed to detect specific patterns, like edges, textures, or shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The filter **slides** (or **convolves**) across the image.\n",
    "- At each position, it computes a weighted sum of the input pixels under the filter.\n",
    "- The result is a **feature map** — a transformed version of the image that highlights specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key idea is that **the network learns the filters automatically** — it figures out which patterns are useful for solving the task (e.g., classifying an image).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Filters in action**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some filters detect **vertical features**:\n",

    "![vertical filter](https://miro.medium.com/max/1338/1*7IEbBib7Yc7qST5IGQoYXA.jpeg)\n",

    "\n",
    "![horizontal filter](https://miro.medium.com/max/1238/1*PSSAaH2pZbl5bK3Ef_zk4A.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is conceptually similar to how **polarized light** highlights specific orientations — which can be a helpful analogy to visualize what CNNs do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Local Connectivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, each neuron is connected only to a small region of the previous layer — its **receptive field** — rather than to all neurons (as in a fully connected layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "We **slide the kernel** over the input, and the neuron in the next layer computes its value **only from the local input pixels under the kernel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![convolution gif](https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*GcI7G-JLAQiEoCON7xFbhg.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This local processing enables CNNs to:\n",
    "- Focus on small details\n",
    "- Reuse patterns across the image\n",
    "- Scale to high-dimensional inputs like images\n",

    "### **Pooling Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "After convolution, we often use **pooling layers** to reduce the size of the feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps:\n",
    "- Decrease computation\n",
    "- Reduce overfitting\n",
    "- Keep only the most important information\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling summarizes nearby pixels into a single value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max pooling** is the most common pooling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It looks at a small region (e.g., $2 \\times 2$) of the feature map\n",
    "- It outputs the **maximum value** from that region\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps the strongest features and throws away the weaker ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of keeping all pixel values, it just keeps the most \"active\" one from each patch.\n",

    "### **Autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "An encoder in a neural network is designed to transform complex or high-dimensional input data into a compact, meaningful representation — while preserving the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the deep-learning to the problem of dimensionality reduction.**  You can think of an autoencoder as doing PCA with a neural network -- breaking our data down into the only the most important features that we actually need (finding the intrinsic dimensionality). In fact, if the network uses only linear (or no) activation functions and $L2$ cost function, then we have exactly PCA.  \n",

    "### **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**VAEs** are a special kind of autoencoder that do more than just compress and reconstruct data — they also learn the **distribution** behind the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a normal autoencoder, a VAE has two parts:\n",
    "- An **encoder**: compresses input data into a smaller representation\n",
    "- A **decoder**: reconstructs the data from this representation\n",
    "\n",
    "But instead of learning a single vector as the encoding, the encoder learns two things:\n",
    "- A **mean** vector  $\\mu$ \n",
    "- A **standard deviation** vector $\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these, the model samples a latent variable $z$ from a Gaussian distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the encoding **stochastic**, not deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The decoder learns to generate data from different points in this latent space.\n",
    "- You can **sample** new values of $z$, feed them into the decoder, and get **new, realistic data**.\n",
    "- This is useful for **generating new examples** that are similar to the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs consist of two networks:\n",
    "- A **generator** that tries to make fake data,\n",
    "- A **discriminator** that tries to tell if the data is real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are trained together in a sort of game, improving each other over time.  \n",

    "LLMs are deep learning models that can understand and generate human language.  \n",
    "They’re built using **transformers**, a special architecture that captures the relationship between words efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are used in applications like translation, chatbots, and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT = generative pretrained transformers**\n",

    "- **Simulation-Based Inference** is used when traditional statistical methods don’t work well, especially in physics or astronomy, where simulations are easier to get than real data.\n",
